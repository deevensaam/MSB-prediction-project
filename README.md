About Project:
To predict the mortgage backed securities prepayment risk usimg machine learning models like Random forest and Support Vector Machines. Deployment done using flask and heroku.

About Dataset :
The data is obtained from Freddie Mac official portal for home loans. The size of the home loans data is (291452 x 28). It contains 291452 data points and 28 columns or parameters which denote different features of the data.

HARP indicator â€“ denotes if the loan is HARP or non-HARP and Interest only indicator - Denotes if the loan requires only the interest
